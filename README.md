# Meme Maker

This is a basic meme maker I have made, which was featured in an open source project which sends memes to WhatsApp groups based on a command. https://github.com/JaydipMagan/WhatBot

First you have to choose which meme template to use. The **Templates** directory has the meme templates available, you can add as many memes templates as you wish

    Meme templates available:

    1. Professionals Have Standards
    2. Man of Quality
    ...

    Enter meme template:


Once you have chosen a meme template you have three options to decide where the text you want should go:


    Text options:

    1. Top text
    2. Bottom text
    3. Top and Bottom text

    Enter option:

By default **Impact** font is being used, which can be downloaded from

http://www.911fonts.com/font/download_ImpactRegular_5200.htm

After choosing the text option you need to provide the text and the meme will be made.
The program will open the meme so you can see it and there is an option to save the memes.
The **Saved** directory contains all the meme saved that were made using the program, the user choses the name
for the meme

## Further improvements
This has been improved as by the suggestions. You can now create two type of memes:

	MEME MAKER

	1. Basic

	2. Advanced

	Enter meme type:

The **basic** meme template will be a regular meme using impact font and black color.
The **advanced** option:
- Will allow you to choose from a list of fonts available and more can be added from: http://www.911fonts.com
- Will allow you to choose a specific colour for the font you want.

Thanks for these suggestions, any suggestions are welcome :)
